    <h1>The Infinite Monkey Theorem</h1>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>According to Wikipedia:</p>
    <p>The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite
        amount of time will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. In
        fact, the monkey would almost surely type every possible finite text an infinite number of times. However, the
        probability that monkeys filling the observable universe would type a complete work such as Shakespeare's Hamlet
        is so tiny that the chance of it occurring during a period of time hundreds of thousands of orders of magnitude
        longer than the age of the universe is extremely low (but technically not zero).</p>
    <p>You can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem">read more about the theorem on
            Wikipedia</a>.

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this project is to try to simulate the theorem by asking the user to enter text in the field
        provided below and see how long it takes for the "monkey" to reproduce the text.</p>
