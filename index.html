            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>According to Wikipedia:</p>
            <p>The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for
                an
                infinite
                amount of time will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William
                Shakespeare. In
                fact, the monkey would almost surely type every possible finite text an infinite number of times.
                However,
                the
                probability that monkeys filling the observable universe would type a complete work such as
                Shakespeare's
                Hamlet
                is so tiny that the chance of it occurring during a period of time hundreds of thousands of orders
                of
                magnitude
                longer than the age of the universe is extremely low (but technically not zero).</p>

            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this project is to try to simulate the theorem by asking the user to enter text in the
                field
                provided below and see how long it takes for the "monkey" to reproduce the text.</p>

        <div class="simulation">
            <h4>Enter text in the input field below:</h4>
            <textarea class="textinput" placeholder="Enter text here..."></textarea>
